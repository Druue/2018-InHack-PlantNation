# Plantnation
Plantnation was an attempt to gamify the household plant tending process. Users of the application can add their plants to be able to better keep track of them. With a relatively simple point system, you too can become a "Master of The Plantiverse", just make sure to water your plants!

# Running the Project
If you wish to simply just run the project, you can find an executable file within the PlantNation/bin/Debug folder. If you otherwise wish to run, debug, _and_ contribute, you will need a copy of Visual Studio from which you can edit and run/debug from the GUI.
